# SDDS - Colour package

# Deprecation Notice

**This package has been deprecated and is no longer actively maintained.**

**Why is this package deprecated?**

This package has reached the end of its development lifecycle, and we have decided to discontinue active support and updates for it. We recommend that you consider alternative solutions for your project to ensure ongoing compatibility, security, and stability.

**Recommended Alternatives**

We suggest exploring the Tegel Design System, which is the successor of SDDS and is actively maintained:

- [@scania/tegel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel): One package for the entire Tegel design system. Based on web components.
- [@scania/tegel-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel-react): Version of @scania/tegel that provides React component wrappers.
- [@scania/tegel-angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@scania/tegel-angular): Version of @scania/tegel that provides Angular component wrappers.

**What should you do now?**

1. **Migrate to an alternative package**: We strongly encourage you to transition to one of the recommended alternatives mentioned above by following their documentation and migration guides on npm, [SDDS -> TDS migration guide](https://tegel.scania.com/development/migration) and [Tegel installation](https://tegel.scania.com/development/getting-started-development/installation) on the official Tegel website.

2. **Remove the deprecated package**: You can safely remove this package from your project once you have successfully migrated to an alternative solution.
