The slider component can be used when users are expected to pick a number. This is done by dragging the scrubber across the track, or use the controls +/- to step.

For full information about all the attributes that can be used to control the slider, please refer to the SDDS storybook, but the main ones are:

min - the minimum value for the slider.
max - the maximum value for the slider.
value - the initial value of the slider.
label - (optional) A label that will be displayed with the slider.
disabled - To put the component in a disabled state.
small - Displays a slightly smaller version of the slider.

To comply with SDDS design there are a few different variants of attributes that should be used:



#No controls variants

<sdds-slider label="A slider" min="0" max="100" value="50">
</sdds-slider>

##With tooltip

Displays a tooltip above the scrubber that presents the current value

<sdds-slider label="A slider" min="0" max="100" value="50" tooltip>
</sdds-slider>

##Tooltip and ticks. 

The number of ticks we want to display is set with the ticks-attribute. Keep in mind that the minimum and maximum tick-indicator will be added automatically.

<sdds-slider ticks="9" label="A slider" min="0" max="100" value="50" tooltip>
</sdds-slider>

##Tooltip, ticks and tick numbers

Like above, but also displays a number above the tick indicator. There is also a possibility to add the "snap"-attribute to make the scrubber automatically snap to the ticks.

<sdds-slider ticks="9" show-tick-numbers snap label="A slider" min="0" max="100" value="50" tooltip>
</sdds-slider>



#Controls variant

This will display a plus- and minus-symbol on each side that the user can click on to increase or decrease the value of the slider. The step-attribute can be used to control how much to increase/decrease the value when the controls are used.

<sdds-slider controls step="1" label="A slider" min="0" max="100" value="50" tooltip>
</sdds-slider>



#Input variant

This variant will show an input field so the user can enter a number manually instead of dragging the slider.

<sdds-slider input label="A slider" min="0" max="100" value="50" tooltip>
</sdds-slider>


Both the Controls- and Input-variant also supports the "show-tick-numbers" and "ticks" attributes.
