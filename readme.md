# Scania Digital Design System components and theme

[https://digitaldesign.scania.com/](https://digitaldesign.scania.com/)

The design system supports the design and development of digital solutions at Scania. The purpose is to secure a coherent and premium brand and user experience across all of Scania's digital touchpoints.

## Getting started

You can use SDDS CSS custom properties to use the design tokens for colour, typography, spacing, and logotype. To have all CSS custom properties available, you need to install both compoonents and scania-theme. And then you need to include `c-theme` component in your application. Check instruction below on how to install components and scania-theme.
